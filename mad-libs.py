#### Mad Libs Story Maker ####
# Create a Mad Libs style game, where the program asks the user for certain
# types of words, and then prints out a story with the words that the user
# inputted.

# [-] The story doesn't have to be too long, but it should have some sort of
#     story line.
# [-] Tip: it's easiest to write out a quick story on a piece of paper or a
#     word document, and then go back through and see which words the user
#     should be able to change.

# Subgoals:
# [-] If the user has to put in a name, change the first letter to a capital letter.
# [-] Change the word "a" to "an" when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel.
